# PROMFI

This repository contains the top-level PROMFI project families.

Each folder below represents a **Project Family**, structured according to the PROMFI UIS (Universal Identification System). All PROMFI files, folders, and identifiers are version-controlled and organized according to PLP, SWBS/RSP, TAP, and RMP protocols.

| Folder       | Description                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| [00000.00](./00000.00) | General Information, Templates, and Reference Models     |
| [10000.00](./10000.00) | Company-Related Projects and Internal Operations         |
| [20000.00](./20000.00) | Client Projects and External Deliverables                |
| [30000.00](./30000.00) | Research & Development Projects                         |
| [40000.00](./40000.00) | Robotics, Automation, and AI Systems                    |

## PROMFI Overview

**PROMFI** stands for **Project Manager and File Identification System**.  
It provides a rigorous, hierarchical framework for managing files, tasks, and documentation across engineering, programming, R&D, and general information systems.

Each file and folder is assigned a structured PROMFI ID based on:
- **PLP** – Project Logger Protocol  
- **SWBS/RSP** – System Work Breakdown & Resource Structuring Protocol  
- **TAP** – Task Allocation Protocol  
- **RMP** – Relationship Management Protocol

## Using This Repository

Each project family (e.g., `10000.00`, `20000.00`) contains subprojects identified by PROMFI IDs (e.g., `10201-2110_DR-aa`). Files inside these folders may include:

- README.md – Overview of each subproject or component
- `.json` – Metadata and structured project information
- `.ipt`, `.iam`, `.dwg`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx` – Engineering models, drawings, and spreadsheets

To understand the structure:
- Start from the root README
- Explore each family folder
- Review associated JSON metadata for structured definitions
- All file names follow PROMFI ID syntax

## PROMFI Version

**Current PROMFI Version**: `4.0` (AI-Integrated, Spreadsheet-to-GUI Transition Phase)

> Originally built using spreadsheets and file naming conventions, PROMFI now evolves into a software-based system integrating AI-driven automation, structured JSON metadata, and version-controlled repositories.
