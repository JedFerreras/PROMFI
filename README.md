## PROMFI Overview

**PROMFI** stands for **Project Manager and File Identification System**, a structured system for managing projects, folders, relationships, and documentation across engineering, AI, and automation workflows.

Key components include:
- **PLP** – Project Logger Protocol
- **SWBS/RSP** – System Work Breakdown Structure / Resource Structuring Protocol
- **TAP** – Task Allocation Protocol
- **RMP** – Relationship Management Protocol

## Using This Repository

Each top-level folder is a PROMFI family and contains subprojects as identified by PROMFI IDs (e.g., `10200.00`, `00085.00`).

Subfolders and files may include:
- PROMFI-compliant metadata files (`.json`)
- Hierarchically structured subfolders
- Documentation in markdown
- Drawings, models, spreadsheets (internal only)

## PROMFI Version

Current HEAD version uses an organized, spreadsheet-first, Git-tracked format.

Long-term development will transition this system to a formal GUI-based application with AI integration.
